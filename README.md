## Overview
**HandScript** is a machine learning project that leverages deep learning models to convert handwritten text into digital, editable format. This tool aims to simplify the process of digitizing handwritten notes, making them more accessible and easier to manage.

## Features
- Accurate conversion of handwritten text to digital format.
- Supports multiple handwriting styles.
- Scalable to recognize different languages.
- Customizable training model for fine-tuning on specific handwriting datasets.
- Real-time conversion through a simple UI.

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/HandScriptAI.git
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**  
   Navigate to the project directory and install required packages:
   ```bash
   cd HandScriptAI
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download Dataset**  
   Ensure the required dataset is available in the `data/` directory.

## Usage
1. **Train the Model**  
   Train the handwriting recognition model with your dataset:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py --data data/handwriting
   ```

2. **Convert Handwriting to Text**  
   Use the pre-trained model to convert handwriting images to text:
   ```bash
   python convert.py --input images/handwriting_sample.png
   ```

## Technologies
- Python
- TensorFlow / PyTorch (for model training)
- OpenCV (for image preprocessing)
- Flask (for web interface)

## Dataset
The model is trained on a custom dataset of handwritten notes. You can also use publicly available datasets such as:
- [IAM Handwriting Database](http://www.fki.inf.unibe.ch/databases/iam-handwriting-database)
- [MNIST Handwritten Digits](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

## Model
The project uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image feature extraction and a recurrent neural network (RNN) for sequence generation to convert images of handwritten text into a digital string.
